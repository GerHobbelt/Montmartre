Montmartre
==========

Presentation framework inspired by (and borrowing a thing or two from) RevealJS from Hakim el Hattab. Use Montmartre whether your presentation is testing the classic boundaries of the presentation paradigm or you want your slide transitions to be controlled even when some of your slides contain complex logic and/or styling. Uses BeatMaster as a fundament.
